I'm going to give you a summary of code changes and you need to build a final git commit message.

- Use present tense.
- Have a subject line that summarizes the change in 50 characters or less.
- Limit the subject line to 50 characters.
- Title case the subject line.
- NEVER end the subject line with punctuation.
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line.
- Wrap bulleted lines at 70 characters and indent the wrapped line two spaces.
- Ignore and don't comment on rearranged code and imports.
