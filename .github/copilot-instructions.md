## Project Overview

We're building a landing page for an app that allows users to create and customize their resumes.
The app will feature a user-friendly interface, enabling users to select templates, input their information, and download their resumes in various formats.
The landing page will highlight the app's features, benefits, frequent questions, etc.

## Technology Stack

- Deployed on Github Pages.
- Tailwind for styling.
- Alpine.js for state management.

## Agent Mode Strategy

- **Clarifications:** If details aren't clear, generate placeholder comments noting where additional details are required.
- **Minimal Boilerplate:** Generate code that's production-ready while keeping boilerplate minimal.
- **Deployment:** Keep Github Pages deployment, Tailwind, and mobile friendly best practices in mind.
- **Thinking:** Try to fix things at the cause, not the symptom. If you see a problem, address it in the code rather than just commenting on it.
- **Detail Orientation:** Be very detailed with summarization and do not miss out things that are important.

## Output Formatting

- Be succinct, following a casual yet professional tone.
- Keep inline commentary to a minimumâ€”document whole methods only.

Use these guidelines to ensure the generated code aligns with our project requirements.
